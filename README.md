# Fuel Consumption Prediction: Clustering and Regression Models  

## Overview  
This project focuses on predicting city-cycle fuel consumption, measured in miles per gallon (mpg), using a combination of continuous and multi-valued discrete attributes. By clustering the dataset based on car characteristics, we aim to train specialized regression models for each cluster, improving the accuracy of mpg predictions.

## Dataset Description  
The dataset contains information about various car models, their technical specifications, and their fuel efficiency. The attributes are categorized as follows:  

### Target Variable:  
- **`mpg` (Miles Per Gallon):** Continuous variable representing city-cycle fuel consumption.  

### Features:  
#### Multi-Valued Discrete Attributes:  
- **`cylinders (cyl):`** Number of cylinders in the car’s engine.  
- **`model year (yr):`** Year of car manufacture.  
- **`origin:`** Manufacturing region (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia).  

#### Continuous Attributes:  
- **`displacement (disp):`** Total engine swept volume in cubic inches.  
- **`horsepower (hp):`** Engine power output.  
- **`weight (wt):`** Vehicle weight (in pounds).  
- **`acceleration (acc):`** Time required to reach a specific speed (in seconds).  

#### Identifier:  
- **`car name:`** Unique string identifier for each car model (not used as a feature).

## Project Objective  
The goal of this project is to:  
1. **Cluster the dataset**: Segment the data into groups based on similar car attributes using clustering algorithms.  
2. **Train regression models**: Build separate regression models for each cluster to predict `mpg` more accurately.  
3. **Improve prediction accuracy**: Leverage the strengths of clustering to create specialized models that better reflect the relationships within each group.

## Implementation Steps  
1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Handle missing or inconsistent values.  
   - Normalize continuous attributes.  
   - Encode discrete variables where necessary.  

2. **Clustering**:  
   - Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, hierarchical clustering) to group similar car models.  
   - Validate clusters using evaluation metrics.  

3. **Regression Modeling**:  
   - Train regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting) for each cluster.  
   - Evaluate models using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared.  

4. **Analysis and Reporting**:  
   - Compare performance across clusters and evaluate the overall prediction accuracy.  
   - Visualize results to highlight insights and trends in fuel consumption.

## Dependencies  
- **Python Libraries**:  
  - `numpy`, `pandas` – Data manipulation and analysis  
  - `scikit-learn` – Clustering and regression modeling  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – Data visualization
